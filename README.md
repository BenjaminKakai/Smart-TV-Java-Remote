Java Remote Control
This project is a simulation of a smart TV remote control using the Java programming language. The remote control has the following features:

Features
Voice control: Using the microphone in the remote, users can control the TV with voice commands.
Gesture control: The remote can detect gestures, allowing users to control the TV by moving the remote in different directions.
Touchscreen: The remote can have a touchscreen display for navigation and selection of on-screen options.
IR and Wi-Fi connectivity: The remote can connect to the TV using infrared (IR) technology or Wi-Fi, allowing for more flexible use.
Customizable buttons: Users can program the remote's buttons to perform specific actions, such as launching a particular app or adjusting the volume.
Multi-device control: The remote can control other devices connected to the TV, such as soundbars, gaming consoles, and Blu-ray players.
Built-in apps: The remote can include built-in apps, such as a web browser or media player.
Personalization: Users can personalize the remote's interface, including the background and button layout.
